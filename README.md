## What is this repo?

I've been using dgVoodoo for a few years, and it's great for getting older games to work on mordern hardware, but I've allways found dgVoodoo's [website](http://dege.freeweb.hu/) a real bummer, it's very old and basic.

I figured it would be a fun project to make a new website for the project. And a way to thank Dege for his amazing work on dgVoodoo â˜º.

## ToDo list

#### main website:

Still missing some stuff...

- [ ] 'Game patches' page
- [ ] 'DirectX game/demos test results' page
- [ ] find a better solution for navbar
  
#### documentation:

Mostly complete.

- [ ] apply a consistent style
```
samp = file names, output
var = options
b, strong = list titles
```
